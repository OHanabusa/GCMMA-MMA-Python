	"description": "This record contains the Python implementation of the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA), originally developed and written in MATLAB by Krister Svanberg. The MMA algorithm is used for solving non-linear programming problems. Users of this code are encouraged to inform Krister Svanberg of their application and intentions via email, as provided on his website. When publishing work that uses this code, please cite Krister Svanberg's original academic work.",
